# Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.backup_notm}}
{: #getting-started}

Backups ensure that your data is safely stored outside of your device and stays protected. {{site.data.keyword.backup_full}} is an automated agent-based backup system that is managed through the Cloud Backup Portal browser-based management utility. {{site.data.keyword.backup_notm}} provides users with a method to back up data between servers in one or more data centers on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} network. Administrators can set backups to follow a daily, weekly, or custom schedule that targets full systems, specific directories, or even individual files. Extra plug-ins ensure compatibility with software like [MS Exchange](/docs/Backup?topic=Backup-Exchangeplugin), [MS SQL](/docs/Backup?topic=Backup-MSSQLplugin), [Oracle](/docs/Backup?topic=Backup-Oracleplugin#Oracleplugin), [VMware vSphere](/docs/Backup?topic=Backup-VRA), and enable users to complete a [Bare Metal Restore](/docs/Backup?topic=Backup-BMRplugin#BMRplugin), when necessary.

## Accessing the Cloud Backup Portal
{: #accessingPortal}

Cloud Backup Portal is used to interact with the {{site.data.keyword.backup_notm}} service that is offered by {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}. The Portal is a browser-based client that runs on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} private network and allows full control of any {{site.data.keyword.backup_notm}} service, including configuration and restores.

1. Access the Private Network over VPN.

   Cloud Backup Portal can't be accessed over the public network. A VPN connection must be established first.
   {:important}
2. Log in to the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://{DomainName}){: external}. From the Navigational menu, select **Classic Infrastructure**.

3. Select the username of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. Click the expansion arrow to reveal the WebCC portal link.

## Configuring the backup agent and the backup schedule
{: #configureagentschedule}

After you ordered your {{site.data.keyword.backup_notm}} and the agent is installed on the server, you can start creating backups of your data. Through the {{site.data.keyword.backup_notm}} portal, you can manage and monitor your backups. You can choose between manual or automatic backup agent configuration methods.

  - The automatic agent configuration creates a backup job of the complete C Drive (Windows OS) or ./ <root> directory (Linux OS) with Monthly and Daily Retention schemes.

    This job can be modified after it was configured.
    {:note}

    1. Create a password.
    2. Confirm the password.
    3. Add a password hint.
    4. Click **Configure automatically**.

  - If you choose to configure the {{site.data.keyword.backup_notm}} agent manually, the automatic settings are ignored and you can specify the folders and files to be kept with a retention scheme of your choice. For more information, see [Configuring simple file-level backup](/docs/Backup?topic=Backup-configureFileBackup).

      For more information about Retention Schemes, see the [FAQ](/docs/Backup?topic=Backup-faqs#faqs).
      {:tip}

      Archiving is not supported. When you create a retention scheme or modify an existing scheme, make sure that the Archiving option is **not** selected.
